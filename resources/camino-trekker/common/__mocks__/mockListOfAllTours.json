Cutting stencils quickly turned into an obsession, suddenly the stencils were on stickers and walls and that transitioned into an interest in graffiti and screen printing. He switched my major from education to art and received a B.F.A. with an emphasis in printmaking from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities. He has been lucky enough to take what he has learned and obsessed about for all these years and turn that into a job. His work is text heavy and hard lines. He uses comic book characters because he thinks they are instantly relatable to every generation and represent an idealistic time. The text surrounding the characters gives clues as to what the character represents. The bold lines and bright colors associated graffiti and street art still stick with him. He uses his murals as an extension of his fine art. He can do a print and a mural of the same character and each application allows me to explore the character and themes in a different way. The scale of a mural can deliver a feeling that the intimacy of a print can't and he loves exploring that experience.",

Made of <hotword>hard limestone on stop of soft sandstone</hotword>, the falls were rapidly eroding their way upriver.\n\nBeginning in the 19th century, industrialists identified the need to prevent the falls from continuing their natural erosion.

After all, mills were built at this spot long before electricity.\u00a0\n\nTo power a mill from a waterfall, you begin by digging a canal above the falls. Water flows along this canal, and then enters a mill, where it drops down a long shaft. At the bottom of that shaft is a <hotword>turbine</hotword>, which spins as the water flows through it. A shaft leads up from the turbine into the mill, and from there belts and gears drive the machinery of the mill. Finally, the water leaves the mill through a tailrace, having dropped back to the new level of the river.\u00a0\n\nWhat you see before you are the ruins of a number of mills and the tailrace leading back to the river. We'll see the start of the canal a bit later on. This part of the river was once lined with a number of small mills. The twisted iron once supported a railway trestle to allow the mills to easily load and unload.",
