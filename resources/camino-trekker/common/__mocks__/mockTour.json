You can park on either side of the river - there's a lot just north of the bridge on the downtown side of the bridge, and plenty of street parking on the St. Anthony Main side.\n\nUse the \"next\" button in the upper right to move to the next stop. Each stop will include navigation instructions, as well as informational material.\n\nAs you move through your tour, you might come across \"hotwords\". These are underlined words that you can tap to mark. At the end of your tour, we'll give you a list of the words you marked, with additional information so you can dive deeper.\n\nAlong the way, you'll see some interpretive signage from the St. Anthony Falls Heritage Trail.

Water flows along this canal, and then enters a mill, where it drops down a long shaft. At the bottom of that shaft is a <hotword>turbine</hotword>, which spins as the water flows through it. A shaft leads up from the turbine into the mill, and from there belts and gears drive the machinery of the mill. Finally, the water leaves the mill through a tailrace, having dropped back to the new level of the river.\u00a0\n\nWhat you see before you are the ruins of a number of mills and the tailrace leading back to the river.
