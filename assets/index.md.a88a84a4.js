These tours allow you to go beyond the &quot;tourist&quot; level, and dive deep on subjects that interest you. Anyone can build tours with Camino, using nothing more than a web browser. And anyone can take a Camino tour, using nothing more than their smartphone or tablet - no software to install, nothing to buy, and no sketchy advertising companies tracking your location.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re passionate about history, geography, art, food or nature, consider how you can share your expertise with those in your community. We&#39;re still in the early stages of building Camino, but we plan to offer guides and webinars to help support and inspire you. For now, play around, and let us know what you think.</p><h2 id="taking-a-tour" tabindex="-1">Taking a Tour <a class="header-anchor" href="#taking-a-tour" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>You can browse the available tours at the &quot;<a href="http://camino.cla.umn.edu/findTours" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Find Tours</a>&quot; page.

When you receive a direct link to a tour, that tour hasn&#39;t been reviewed or verified by anyone.</p><p>Camino tours take you through a series of stops. At each stop, you&#39;ll have a mix of navigational information, guide information, and potentially images, augmented reality views, or interactive elements.</p><h3 id="using-the-navigation-features" tabindex="-1">Using the Navigation Features <a class="header-anchor" href="#using-the-navigation-features" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>We encourage our tour creators to write useful, descriptive instructions to move you from stop to stop. We encourage you to try to follow them - look at your surroundings, observe what you see and how it compares to the description, and find your way. If you get stuck though, there&#39;ll always be a map button that you can use, which will show you your current location and the destination. Follow the compass to find your way (following any appropriate rules or laws - no tresspassing!).</p>',8),r=[i];function s(u,h,l,d,c,p){return o(),t("div",null,r)}var m=e(n,[["render",s]]);export{y as __pageData,m as default};
